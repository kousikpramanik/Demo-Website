  <h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</h3>
  <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human
    mind such as learning and problem-solving.

    The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal. A subset of artificial intelligence is machine learning, which refers to the concept that
    computer programs can automatically learn from and adapt to new data without being assisted by humans. Deep learning techniques enable this automatic learning through the absorption of huge amounts of unstructured data such as text, images, or
    video.</p>

  <h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI) In Our Daily Life</h3>
  <p> Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing business as we know it, but what many people don’t realize—or at least don’t think about—is how AI is also impacting our lives outside of the office.

  <ol>
    <li> <strong>Self-Driving And Parking Vehicles: </strong> Self-driving and parking cars use deep learning, a subset of AI, to recognize the space around a vehicle. Technology company Nvidia uses AI to give cars “the power to see, think, and
      learn, so they can navigate a nearly infinite range of possible driving scenarios,” Nvidia explains on its website. The company’s AI-powered technology is already in use in cars made by Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Volvo, and Tesla, and is sure
      to revolutionize how people drive—and enable vehicles to drive themselves.</li>
    <li> <strong>Digital Assistants: </strong> Apple’s Siri, Google Now, Amazon’s Alexa, and Microsoft’s Cortana are digital assistants that help users perform various tasks, from checking their schedules and searching for something on the web, to
      sending commands to another app. AI is an important part of how these apps work because they learn from every single user interaction. This allows them to better recognize speech patterns and serve users results that are tailored to their
      preferences. Microsoft says that Cortana is “continually learns about its user” and that it will eventually anticipate user needs. </li>
    <li> <strong>Vehicle Recognition Identification: </strong> Companies such as PlateSmart, IntelliVision, and Sighthound, among others, use computer vision—a form of AI that can see and understand images—along with deep learning to turn
      conventional surveillance into vehicle monitoring; this is a very important part of integrated traffic systems and also a big help to authorities as well, as surveillance videos are now searchable for specific plate numbers. That’ll make you
      think twice about blowing through that red light. </li>
    <li> <strong>Robots: </strong> The Roomba 980 model vacuum (the one that cleans your floor on its own) uses AI to scan a living area’s size, look for objects that might be in the way, and remember the best route for cleaning the carpet. The
      vacuum bot can also identify how much cleaning it needs to do based on the size of the room, repeating a cleaning cycle three times in smaller rooms or cleaning twice in a medium-sized room. </li>
    <li> <strong>Transportation: </strong> Machine learning, another subset of AI, powers some of the magic that happens inside of apps like Uber. </li>
