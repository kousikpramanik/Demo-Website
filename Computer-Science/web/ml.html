  <h3>About:</h3>
  <p>Cloud computing[1] is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user.[2] The term is generally used to describe data centers
    available to many users over the Internet.[3] Large clouds, predominant today, often have functions distributed over multiple locations from central servers. If the connection to the user is relatively close, it may be designated an edge server.
  </p>

  <h3>What is Cloud Computing?</h3>
  <p>Cloud computing is on-demand access, via the internet, to computing resources—applications, servers (physical servers and virtual servers), data storage, development tools, networking capabilities, and more—hosted at a remote data center managed
    by a cloud services provider (or CSP). The CSP makes these resources available for a monthly subscription fee or bills them according to usage.</p>

  <h3>Cloud computing services</h3>
  <p>IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service), PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) , and SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) are the three most common models of cloud services, and it’s not uncommon for an organization to use all three. However, there is often confusion
    among the three and what’s included with each.
  <ul>
    </li><strong>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</strong>
    <p>A vendor provides clients pay-as-you-go access to storage, networking, servers, and other computing resources in the cloud.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Platform as a service (PaaS)</strong>
      <p>A service provider offers access to a cloud-based environment in which users can build and deliver applications. The provider supplies underlying infrastructure.</p>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Software as a service (SaaS)</strong>
      <p>A service provider delivers software and applications through the internet. Users subscribe to the software and access it via the web or vendor APIs.</p>
    </li>

  </ul>
